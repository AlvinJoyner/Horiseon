## Description
- Mt Mtoivation tfor this website was to shorten and tidy up any code that was in HTML and CSS
- I built this Project to show that i can understand and make any lines inside of the files have more meaning to the user of the website. So the disabled can use the website just as efficently.
- The problems that kept reoccuring was unnamed lins of code that was not accessible to all viewrs. 
i learned how to make the website more accessible for everyone. All viewrs from all platforms can actively view the website
## Installation
The steps that was required to install the project was giving value to div commands. example : changing <div> to <main> when the content inside is refering to the main context of the website
